# Seven Sages Brewing Company Data Analysis

In this project, I created a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company. My data model made it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

At the end, I applied the key concepts I learned to combine and centralize data that was previously siloed, solving a very common issue facing many companies. 
More importantly, I have now a solid foundation to build on when it came to more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models.
